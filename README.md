App Idea: EcoBuddy
My app idea is called EcoBuddy. Itâ€™s an app that helps people live more sustainably by making small, easy changes in their daily lives. The app would have challenges like reducing single-use plastics, conserving energy, or upcycling old clothes. You can track your progress and earn badges for completing eco-friendly goals. There would also be a feature to share tips and ideas with others in the community. The app could even suggest local recycling centers or thrift stores to encourage people to make greener choices. 

## Notes

opening the swift file side by side with the playground. 
getting the app to display properly when run. 
the instructions for the code is vague.
